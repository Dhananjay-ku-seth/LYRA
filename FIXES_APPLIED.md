# LYRA 3.0 - Issues Fixed âœ…

## Summary
All major issues reported have been resolved. LYRA 3.0 is now fully functional.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… System Status Monitoring
**Problem**: CPU, RAM, temperature status not showing
**Solution**: 
- Fixed system monitoring in `main.py` with proper cross-platform support
- Added real-time internet connectivity checking
- Implemented proper Windows disk usage monitoring
- Status updates every 30 seconds to GUI

### 2. âœ… Voice Recognition & TTS
**Problem**: Voice not working, not taking speech input, not replying
**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote `core/voice_input.py` with working speech recognition
- Implemented continuous listening with Google Speech Recognition
- Fixed `core/tts_output.py` with pyttsx3 text-to-speech
- Added proper voice callbacks and threading
- Voice commands now processed through decision engine

### 3. âœ… Internet Connectivity
**Problem**: Connected to internet but showing "connecting"
**Solution**:
- Added proper internet connection checking in `check_internet_connection()`
- Real-time connectivity status updates to GUI
- Multiple fallback methods for connectivity testing

### 4. âœ… Text Messaging/Commands
**Problem**: Not taking text messages
**Solution**:
- Fixed text command processing through WebSocket
- Commands properly routed through decision engine
- Real-time responses displayed in GUI and spoken via TTS

### 5. âœ… Operational Modes
**Problem**: Modes not working
**Solution**:
- Fixed mode switching in decision engine
- All modes (Home, Defense, Night, Manual) now functional
- Mode changes reflected in GUI with visual indicators
- Proper command pattern matching for mode switches
